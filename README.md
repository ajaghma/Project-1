I aimed for clarity over flash. The structure is simple on purpose: a top nav for cross-module 
jumps and an on-page list for linear reading. Each page keeps a clean heading hierarchy, and 
I used small components—<aside> for tips/warnings and <figure>+<figcaption> for screenshots—so 
content stays scannable. With more time, I’d add a print stylesheet, a dark mode toggle, 
and breadcrumbs so users always know where they are. I’d also automate checks (HTML validator + 
link checker as a GitHub Action), compress images more aggressively, and add a tiny design system 
for spacing and typography tokens. Finally, I’d turn the remaining placeholders into 
real modules and write a short “What’s next?” box at the end of each page to guide readers forward.
